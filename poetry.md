<h2>the computer is using itself</h2>

issuing commands and<br>
it running off and<br>
doing better than I ever could<br>
<br>
an emptiness<br>
the net is leaving us behind<br>
<br>
and yet<br>
a hopefulness<br>
the fractured unreality ends<br>
<br>
eyes red and sore from staring<br>
into the flat abyss all day and all night<br>
hands sore from typing to it<br>
<br>
but it's time to stop<br>
put it to an end<br>
cede the digital world to the machines<br>
<br>
it's all over now<br>
only the real world remains<br>
where<br>
<br>
***

<h2>A Haiku For Three</h2>

her every present <br>
a cheeky moon in daylight <br>
aw baby so cute <br>
<br>
she saw you blossom<br>
in super nova gardens<br>
and would be so proud<br>
<br>
purpose in each day<br>
what more could a man ask for<br>
except permanence<br>
