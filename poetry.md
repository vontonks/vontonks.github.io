<h2>the computer is using itself</h2>

issuing commands and
it running off and
doing better than I ever could

and yet
an emptiness
the net is leaving us behind

and yet
a hopefulness
the fractured unreality ends

eyes red and sore from staring
into the flat abyss all day and all night
hands sore from typing to it

but it's time to stop
put it to an end
cede the digital world to the machines

it's all over now
only the real world remains
where

***


<h2>A Haiku For Three</h2>

her every present <br>
a cheeky moon in daylight <br>
aw baby so cute <br>
<br>
she saw you blossom<br>
in super nova gardens<br>
and would be so proud<br>
<br>
purpose in each day<br>
what more could a man ask for<br>
except permanence<br>
