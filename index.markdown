<h1>BLOG</h1>

Welcome to my very own SITE here on the WORLD WIDE WEB

(it cost nothing for me to host this lol).

Um so this is the front page of the blog I guess.

Click on that there Blog button up on the top right to see a page with blogs arranged chronologically.

This link also works: <a href=https://vontonks.github.io/blog.html>https://vontonks.github.io/blog.html</a>

Don't think the categories thing is working though so that's something to consider...
