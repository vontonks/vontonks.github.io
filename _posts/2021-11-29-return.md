Okay. Well actually I just closed -- nevermind.

I haven't used this for a while and don't remember how to write an emdash or really do anything on this blog but that's okay, it's still here. Should probably back the whole thing up, or did I do that recently? Might have.

I think this was where I've been working on my twitter bot blog and that's fine. I really just kind of got moving and then pushed it out and haven't done anything since. Been meaning to get like a raspberry pi or something so I can run it on that all time. I really should get around to doing that one of these days.

Now if I have configured this right, I should be able to just write this stuff in here, then save it, and the site should update. I have no idea how long that might take if it is the case.

Thinking about it, that doesn't make any sense. I've opened GitHub Desktop (because I'm lazy and if I wanted to use command line I'd be running Linux) and yeah there's the changes. I'll just have to hit commit and hopefully it'll work on the other end.

Hmm, I need to write a description of what this commit is about so it's an opportunity to say something silly but actually I probs should just do the right thing and explain what this commit was for.

I really should only do that at the end though to save me constantly updating. Maybe this is as good a time as any to stop the blog post. Okay, I will.
