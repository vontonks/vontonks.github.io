Today I write in the terminal just to prove to myself that I can. It means nothing yet I do it anyway. This is part of the website form piece I mention in <a href="{{ "/blog/2024/09/26/been-a-while.html" | relative_url }}">this post</a>. I have this urge to strip away software layers and interface as directly with the machine as possible.

Anyway, it's been five days since I was last here, writing about <a href="{{ "/blog/2024/10/02/review-neuromancer.html" | relative_url }}">*Neuromancer*</a>. In that time, I finished a big work thing, then it was the long weekend. Saturday was a run around because I needed to clean the place for the open inspection because the owner is selling the joint. Ugh. Then we had Penelope's swimming lesson, came back, did some housework, went to the shops. From some time that afternoon, I started crashing. Went to bed around 8.30pm. 

Woke up to Penelope holding presents in my face. It was my birthday! I had a lovely sleep in then Sama made me a bacon and egg roll. We got ourselves together, made sure Daisy was fed and walked, then took Penny's car seat over to my sister-in-law's so we could all drive to the Early Start Discovery Centre in Woolongong.

That was such a fun trip. Parents learn very quickly the value of child-friendly spaces. They need to move around, seeing new things, touching things, playing, experimenting. The Discovery Centre was purpose built for exactly that and seeing kids have a place of their own is really special and heartwarming. Still a lot of work for the parents though who follow their excited kids around with an ever-increasing fatigue.

Parenting has brought a different kind of fatigue, I've found. And I wouldn't change it for anything.
