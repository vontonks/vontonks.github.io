Ok, we're back. I guess I've been avoiding this part of the whole thing for some time. You know, the writing part. It's been over 2 years since my <a href='https://vontonks.github.io/blog/2022/09/14/back-again.html'>last post</a>. 

It's so weird. I've spent over an hour getting the local environment setup with a Jekyll server just so I can see what the damn blog post looks like and if that links are working properly.

Mostly I've been getting OpenAI to do my troubleshooting. It's helpful because I have a tendency to skip ahead or just brute force my way through things which can feel like it's fast but takes longer overall. Unless you can ask for help constantly by a bot that doesn't get annoyed at me taking a little while to get things.

This is the thing I'm not sure I've covered properly before but I have this desire to want to be able to make my website from within a text editor. The old fashioned way.

I don't know what that's about. Something to do with form. A website is just code which is just pages. The thing about a site is how it has these different versions: we read back through ever more coded ways of expressing the same thing until you see 1s and 0s.

The web page is limited in its artistic illusion in a way that more complex digital media aren't. What video game developers see, the complexity of textures and programs and sub-programs and physics engines is far greater than the final interaction: playing the game. 

Consider the most basic website in flat HTML. When you debug that -- which is to say look at the code that your browser sees -- it is still just as readable as the final form. There's something strange about viewing the page source for what is an aesthetically elegant design and just getting hit by a wall of indecipherable garbage.

That's just modern publishing, though. You need a proper content management system (CMS) to do all the things that a modern CMS lets you do easily. Templated design, integration with other products, especially email lists, ads, and other ecommerce thingos.

TIME PASSES

It is now the next day. I was up until midnight messing around with this stuff. There's been some weird problems with getting Jekyll to install on the version of Ruby I had which probably could have been avoided by going directly to the Jekyll site and following instructions there instead of relying on ChatGPT. Like, it worked in the end. The problem was that I installed the latest version of Ruby when I needed 2.7. Anyway, it was a useful lesson and I have now, at 9.50am *the next day*, I've finally got Jekyll serving my site to localhost. This gets the blog back to where it was in 2022, basically. Oh well, at least it works. Now what?
