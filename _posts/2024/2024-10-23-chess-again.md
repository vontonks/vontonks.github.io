what am I doing man. Just sitting here, feeling lost and half aware. Stay with me buddy we're going to be just fine let's keep writing into the terminal while we wait for Patto to play his chess move.

The current state of the game: 1. e4 Nc6 2. Bc4 e6 3. Nh3 d5 4. Bb3 dxe4 5. Nc3 f5 6. Qh5+

I fell down a pawn because I didn't protect it in my opening. It's a basic mistake but it is what it is. The important thing about chess is to focus on the current state of the game and play from there. Maybe a zen lesson there, too.

I'd like to improve but it takes a bit of time and effort both of which are somewhat limited. What I want to do is write more. More more more more more more. And read more. But I'm addicted to the sweet brain scratching of scrolling social media.

No more wasted time.
We are immortal
The line is drawn
I plan my devotion
There is no turning back.

That's my writing down the lyrics to For You by Killswitch Engage as I heard them. I really dig this album. It's epic as hell and, as far as I can tell, lyrically unproblematic which is the relatively low bar I've set for music from my youth.

this might just be something I don't send out into the world. that's fine. I've kind of missed that somewhat.

*EDITOR'S NOTE: I have decided to send this out. Not because it's good (it clearly isn't) but rather as a commitment to writing publicly habit.*

So the chess game. I'm aiming to swap my bishops so they sit on b3 and g3. It came from this book which I don't have directly in front of me so I can't reference it. 

Just by the way, Gerald Murnane's personal library of notes is amazing. No machine knows how he thinks in the way some might have gathered from my very online method of writing.

Not sure I'm going to get a full game out of Patto tonight. Might look for a 30min game. The key for me is concentration. Got to get an opening down.

*TIME PASSES*

Interesting game. Opponent crashed his bishop into my knight after I castled kingside, opening a huge hole. He's pushed up my flank and has a mildly threatening attack with a knight but I've gone and thought I did a genius move with c5 and ... I lost. Got smashed, actually. It's happening a lot. I should get back to reading the book. Maybe I should think about a different aspect of the game. I've been particularly bishop centric for a little while...

*TIME PASSES*

Might win a game. Feel like it worked a bit better. Again trying the Bb3 and Bg3 play. Made some mistakes but hey a win's a win. Should stand up and take a break.

I think just having this goal of the bishops on b3/6 and g3/6 has given me a better sense of strategy. Unsure if that was the intention behind the book talking about the Ruy Lopez...

11pm 
Penny has started crying, the poor love. Will give her a few minutes before I go in.

...

Seems she's gone back to sleep. Only 3 minutes awake. Patto and I have traded knights for bishops. I've retained mine and we're going to fiancetto  with a Q side castle. It's becoming quite a closed game. I think that favours the player with bishops (?) SO I'm feeling in a good spot. Nothing is under threat

I've been here before, playing chess. Picked it up during my last year of uni it became a massive distraction, as it's becoming once more.
