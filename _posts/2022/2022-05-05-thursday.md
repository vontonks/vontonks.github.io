Well, I'm still trying to get this thing going.

Having trouble pulling categories out and I've gone back to the old day title because it pulls the date in the post anyway 
and I think that looks fine and now it looks silly with the full date. So yeah other titles will have to do I suppose.

We're experimenting, it's all good.

Feeling drained again today. Foggy brain, even though I didn't play video games last night. Difficulty concentrating but at least 
the newsletter is going well and, yeah, life goes on I suppose.

Just tired. All the time. Unmotivated etc. 

Ah well, it's a decent day outside. I'll just leave this here for now I guess.
