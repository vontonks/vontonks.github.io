Been a couple of months, hey? Like, June. We've since moved home and gotten married. 

The new place is great, in an apartment block that has a gym and a pool so we're max chilling. Weird smell from the laundry but it doesn't leak so we're much happier.

Wedding was the best day of my life. Should do a whole blog about it. Need to write the whole day up. 
Was genuinely incredible to have all our friends and family join us and then have so much fun on the night. Couldn't have asked for a better day, truly. 
Sama did an amazing job getting things together. She really drove the whole thing. As always, it's her getting changes done. Same with moving!

Yeah, I should write a whole detailed wedding run-through some time. I'll put it on a list (which I've just created) of blog post ideas. 
We're actually meeting with our photographer next Monday to finally get the photos. 
Oh man, I genuinely can't wait! It's going to be awesome finally seeing the photos and reliving the day. 
I'll try and keep it fresh and write that blog soon after, but no promises.

Anyway, what else is going on? Work is pretty average. Just the whole vibe of the place is pretty down, the work is no good, the organisation people couldn't care less about.
Generally bad, is the thing.

Sama and I have spoken about me finishing up here early next year in order to focus on writing full-time and picking up some freelance work along the way. 
That would be great but I'm not sure how realistic it is as an expectation. Who knows? We'll just have to wait and see. 
I must admit, I don't mind coming into the office at least. It's nice being in a different space to write and think and starting the day with a walk very much helps get my blood flowing. 
Getting up in the morning is a tad bit problematic but I'm still here early enough to see others arriving, so that's all good.

Lovely day here in Sydney. Few light clouds hanging over the South West, but shouldn't be any rain. 
Lots of talk about another La Ni√±a year which is kind of devastating to be honest. 
We've had two consecutive wet summers and it's fucking miserable. Can't go out and enjoy the warmth because it's constantly belting down. Sticky and muggy. Not good.
But we're alright for now, so that's good. Enjoy the decent weather while it lasts.

Okay, well I've got to get to work in a minute. Nice to be back blogging. Shame I haven't been consistent with it but we've had a bit going on. 
I'll try to return again. 
Honestly, I miss writing. I used to do it for fun but lately it's felt pointless. 
I have a whole list of short stories I've been working on packaging up but they kind of suck. Just need to do the fucking work. Ugh.
