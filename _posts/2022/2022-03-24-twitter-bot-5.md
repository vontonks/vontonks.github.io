Okay I've gone with a different version of the bot. 

Before it would look at a list and just kind of do random things, now it's a bit more interactive.

So you if you @vontonks on Twitter you should get some kind of a response depending on whether or not the bot is on.

Currently the first part is coded which, if there's a new mention (it knows it's new because it's unliked), the bot will reply to the tweet and say something tOtALLy RaNdOm *holds up spork*.

The next thing is to check and see if that person follows the bot. If so, give them a follow back.

Oh and I'm about to torch all my followers. 

Have signficantly scaled back my twitter use lately so it's not on my phone or work laptop basically meaning I can't absent-mindedly look at it all day every day.

But the thing is that it's kind of necessary for work so I want to get back, but in a different capacity.

The problem with unfollowing a lot of people is that it takes a long time, manually so I made a script for deleting everyone. Just have to turn it on and watch what happens. 

Then build back up, keeping the amount of accounts I follow in line with the amount of followers I have. For balance's sake.
