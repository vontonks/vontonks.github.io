ugh. I'm alright. I guess. In a bit of a partying mood thanks in no small part to Mercury Hard Cider. Drank a can with dinner. Drank a can on my post-dinner constitutional, and started drinking a can while doing the dishes which remains on my desk, the can, as we speak.

It's 9.09pm on a Wednesday night. Bins are out. Got some stories to write tomorrow that have, once again, been left over from today. Classic.

Novel's gone nowhere. Been coughing a fair bit. Moving in a couple days. New responsibilities at work. It's all going on. Not a lot of time to stop and smell the flowers, as an Uber driver said to me this morning on the trip over the bridge to North Sydney.

I was heading to Cisco's local HQ to try out the Hologram -- a bit of augmented reality (AR) telepresence software that is kind of 'meh'. Didn't help that it had some calibration problems but it's also just not super necessary now. We have video calls with our laptops and phones, devices that are already extensions of ourselves, so the idea of putting on a clunky headset and sitting in front of a bank of cameras in order to let them experience you in something that's closer to 3D is a little unnecessary.

Don't get me wrong, I think the tech is cool and we're not going to 'innovate' without companies trying to push out these products. But like what are we 'innovating' for? To make money. That's, uh, kind of it. Now if you take the position that money moves us further down this linear path of technology and science that heads toward some kind of _better future_ then maybe sure let's 'innovate' for the sake of it but there's a lot of assumptions made there.

Not enough time spent thinking about why we do things, is my current attitude I suppose. Not that I'm much better at that. 

Need to go to bed soon. Had my eye on a game of dota but I'm not so sure now. Might just open up Skyrim til 10pm and then go to bed.
