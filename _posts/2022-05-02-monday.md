Well another day etc etc. Once again I'm awake late which is what it is but I've had time to make coffee and stuff so that's positive.

Bit going on this morning with a job interview at 10am and then some meetings and a call with a source who wants to discuss how a TAFE teaches cyber security which he says
is not particularly good at all. That was in relation to <a href = 'https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2022/ict-graduates-aren-t-job-ready.html'>this story</a> which has generated
quite a bit of interest from our readers so a follow-up could be worth talking about.

So I should probably contact that particular TAFE and TAFE Directors Australia for comment -- but do I do that before or after? Hmmm.
Let's do it after I speak with this guy so I can put specific questions to them.

What else? Yeah meetings and things. Let's have a look at the day's headlines and see what's going on in the tech world.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT thing (company? I don't know) has raised some US$300 million by <a href = 'https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/01/bayc-team-raises-285m-with-otherside-nfts-clogs-ethereum/'>
selling plots of metaverse land</a> and completely clogging up Ethereum, causing gas prices to soar. BAYC fans, cultists, investors, whatever, 
spent some US$176 million in gas fees during the virtual lab grab. Utter madness. If you think the price of Ethereum or any of 
these assets is accurate you have monkey brains -- it's nonsense. But fun.

A look at how authoritarian regimes have been using <a href = 'https://restofworld.org/2022/blackouts/'>
internet shutdowns</a> over the last seven years.
  
The Wikimedia Foundation has decided to <a href = 'https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Stop_accepting_cryptocurrency_donations'>
stop accepting cryptocurrency donations </a>after a long discussion and vote on the proposal to end crypto donations.
  
The REvil ransomware gang <a href = 'https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/'>
appears to be back </a>after some time on the sidelines following arrests and server takedowns last year.
  
Lol researchers at the Future Interfaces Group are playing around with ways to <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q6dZQfV1x8'>
add mouth haptics to a VR headset </a> which cracks me up. 
The tech they used is "a thin compact beam-forming array of ultrasonic tranducers which focuses acoustic energy onto the mouth.
The combination of different haptics on hands, mouth etc plus different controller methods means these headsets are going to be insane in a few years, legit.
