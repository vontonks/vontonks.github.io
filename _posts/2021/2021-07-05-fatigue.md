Just feeling kinda tired. 

Bored of the Twitter bot now. It's a habit I have actually, getting bored with projects pretty early on. I dunno.

Might go make a coffee maybe?

Been a decent day of work, you know. Just work stuff. Getting the job done. Now I want to spend <em>some</em> time on my personal projects before producing the Pop Fix Podcast tonight but, yeah, not very interested.

Coffee. That'll fix my problems, won't it?

Am aware I've gone from like zero personal projects to one to three very quickly. Common thread in my life as well: getting very excited and over-doing it only to find that I fatigue and get very tired and kind of give up.

Anyway. I'll go make that coffee and work on a poem for a bit.
