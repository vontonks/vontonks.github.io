Sentiment analysis was like way easier to plug in than I'd expected. So much of this work has been done for me that it's really been a matter of making it work for my own purposes.

Now that I know how to get the sentiment analysis working, it's about deciding what kind of sentiment the bot will have.

I'm thinking that, over its life, we'll around with that quite a bit and maybe even do tests to see what kind of sentiment gets what kind of results.

It'll be like a tone thing. And I will be able to tune it to certain settings, playing around it all the while. Using Twitter as an instrument.

On a side note. A neighbour who lives a few doors down stopped to say hello earlier today while Sama and I were transplanting a few eucalypts growing in the gaps of our cementing. He invited us around to take a chunk of a frangipani that he'd just chopped up out the back. 

He invited us in for a beer and a toke and he took us up to his loft where there's a nice pair of big speakers and comfy chairs and we sat around talking about his life and the world and all that good stuff.

So he throws on some jazz for us to chat &mdash; a couple of songs sounded very familiar which I realised was just because they'd been like remixed or whatever but it was nice &mdash; but like it was on a CD. Dude's like 80-odd and what I expected was going to be a sick vinyl collection was, like, a sick CD collection.

So then I kind of thought about how vinyl is having its resurgence or whatever but like is it really better if the information can be transferred through digital files anyway? I dunno. Just a passing thought.
