{{ page.my_number }}

This is me trying to do a blog thing. Is it working yet?

Looks like a second page break will make a second page break. Is that right?

Yup.

There's support for setting up links as variables as well. So if for example I put my Twitter handle as a variable at the bottom of this page and then call it [here][twitter-profile] it should be a link to my Twitter page, right?

Cool.

Do other kinds of <br> page breaks <br> work?

They do!
