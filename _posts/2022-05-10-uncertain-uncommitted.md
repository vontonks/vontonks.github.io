I'm stuck on my novel project and I'm legit like only two weeks in.

See, I thought I had a good idea and but then today I tried to work on it and found that it didn't quite work, was lacking something, that the specifics of <em>why</em> a character -- the main character (at least I think he's the main character, I don't even know anymore) -- is doing what he's doing to set the whole story in motion just kind of didn't make sense.

For nearly an hour I tried to work this out and took it all over the place before writing "stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck" all over my notebook. By the end of my little writing session I was pretty well fed up with the whole thing and ready to just give up. I decided to leave it for the day.

And so then I came to this and now I don't like the layout, it's all just one big long list of posts and just 'meh'. Meh everything.
