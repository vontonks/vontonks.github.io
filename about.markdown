I'm Casey Tonkin, a senior policy advisor at the Australian Computer Society and former tech journalist.

My career sits at the intersection of technology and communication. After completing my Honours in Creative Writing at the University of Adelaide, I spent five years covering Australia's tech industry for Information Age, earning finalist spots at the IT Journalism Awards in 2020 and 2021. In 2024, I moved into policy work, where I now lead strategic projects advocating for Australia's IT sector.

Writing has always been central to what I do. My fiction and poetry have appeared in anthologies published by Palgrave Macmillan, Magic Oxygen, and others. I co-edited *Against the Odds: Care Leavers at University*, and my short story 'Weapon of God' won second place in the inaugural Magic Oxygen Literary Prize.

Outside of work, I was a founding member of the Adelaide University Writers' Group (president in 2016), have performed slam poetry around Adelaide, and spent several years in community radio as a presenter and producer.
